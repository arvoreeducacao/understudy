# Understudy and the persistent-agent products

How Understudy compares with the four products that shaped the idea, and what is still missing. Understudy's column reflects the code on `main` on 7 Oct 2026 (apps/web, apps/computer, apps/host). The other columns reflect public launch material, linked at the end. "Not stated" means the sources do not say, not that the feature is absent.

Legend for Understudy: **has** = works end to end today, **partial** = some of it exists, **missing** = not built.

## Gaps, ranked by value for non-technical teams

1. **Codex parity.** The vault and tool denials work only with Claude; codex stays off by default. *Idea:* run codex's shell in the workbench container once user namespaces are available on the host. Touches computer and host.
2. **An email address for the agent itself.** Today a task has an inbound address, but the agent cannot send from its own mailbox. *Idea:* a per-agent mailbox behind the gatekeeper, with the owner's domain rules applied. Touches web.
3. **Voice replies.** Voice goes in, but replies are text. *Idea:* text-to-speech for chat replies on the phone. Touches web.
4. **Rules that read the page, not just the fields.** Amount limits are checked on the fields typed and submitted, not on totals shown elsewhere on the page. *Idea:* scan the confirmation page for currency amounts before a pay-like click. Touches computer.
