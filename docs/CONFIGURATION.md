# Configuration

Everything is configured through `.env` at the repository root (copy `example.env`). Only `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and `UNDERSTUDY_HOST_TOKEN` are required.

**Panel**

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` | Signs sessions; keep it secret and stable |
| `UNDERSTUDY_HOST_TOKEN` | Shared secret between the panel and the host |
| `UNDERSTUDY_SECRET_KEY` | Encrypts stored tool credentials; defaults to `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` |
| `UNDERSTUDY_PUBLIC_URL` | Address people use to open the panel |
| `UNDERSTUDY_COMPUTER_SERVER_URL` | Address computers use to reach the panel; defaults to the public URL, and the compose default works with Docker Desktop and Linux |
| `UNDERSTUDY_ADMIN_EMAILS` | Comma-separated admins; empty lets the first account become admin |
| `UNDERSTUDY_ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN` | Only these email domains (comma separated) can have accounts and sign up; empty closes public sign-up, so accounts come from an admin, the `create-user` command or Google |
| `UNDERSTUDY_HOST_IDS` | Host ids allowed to connect; empty trusts the first host and asks an admin about any other |
| `UNDERSTUDY_BLOCKED_CIDRS` | Extra address ranges connected tools may never use; private, loopback, link-local, metadata and CGNAT ranges are always blocked |
| `UNDERSTUDY_ALLOW_PRIVATE_MCP` | `1` lets connected tools live on private addresses; local development only |
| `UNDERSTUDY_PRODUCT_NAME` | Name shown in the panel; default `Understudy` |
| `UNDERSTUDY_ARTIFACT_S3_BUCKET` | Bucket for artifact versions and page images. Any S3-compatible store works (AWS S3, MinIO, SeaweedFS, Garage). Empty keeps them in Postgres |
| `UNDERSTUDY_ARTIFACT_S3_ENDPOINT`, `UNDERSTUDY_ARTIFACT_S3_REGION` | Endpoint (default `https://s3.<region>.amazonaws.com`, path-style) and region (default `AWS_REGION` or `us-east-1`) |
| `UNDERSTUDY_ARTIFACT_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `UNDERSTUDY_ARTIFACT_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | Keys for that bucket; fall back to `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` |
| `UNDERSTUDY_ARTIFACT_MAX_BYTES` | Largest file one artifact version can hold (25 MB by default) |
| `UNDERSTUDY_ARTIFACT_ORIGIN` | Optional separate origin (another registrable domain) that serves artifact content; without it content is served from the panel host, already sandboxed with an opaque origin |
| `UNDERSTUDY_LOCALE` | `en` (default) or `pt-BR` |
| `UNDERSTUDY_TIMEZONE` | Time zone for dates and new schedules; default `UTC` |
| `UNDERSTUDY_AGENT_TALK_CEILING` | Most turns in a row understudies may take talking among themselves, in rooms and through messages and hand-offs; empty means no limit, and the owner can always press Stop |
| `UNDERSTUDY_BRIEFING_CRON` | When owners get their daily Slack briefing; default `0 8 * * 1-5` |
| `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`, `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` | Lets understudies talk on Slack; an admin can also paste both in the panel under People |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Adds Google sign-in |
| `UNDERSTUDY_INBOUND_EMAIL_DOMAIN` | Domain whose mail starts tasks; each task gets `<task>.<random>@<domain>`. Empty turns inbound email off |
| `UNDERSTUDY_INBOUND_SNS_TOPIC_ARN`, `UNDERSTUDY_INBOUND_S3_BUCKET` | With Amazon SES receiving: the only SNS topic and S3 bucket the panel accepts mail from |
| `UNDERSTUDY_INBOUND_TOKEN` | With any other provider: bearer token (24+ characters) for posting raw MIME to `/api/inbound/email` |

**Host**

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `UNDERSTUDY_COMPUTER_IMAGE` | The only computer image the host runs; default `understudy-computer:local` |
| `UNDERSTUDY_HOST_ID` | Name the host reports to the panel |
| `UNDERSTUDY_HOST_CAPACITY` | Maximum computers at once; default one per 2 GB of memory, keeping 2 GB |
| `UNDERSTUDY_COMPUTER_NETWORK` | Docker network for computers, created without inter-container traffic; default `understudy-agents` |
| `UNDERSTUDY_COMPUTER_EXTRA_HOSTS` | Extra host names for computers; the compose default lets them reach the panel on this machine |
| `UNDERSTUDY_ALWAYS_PULL` | `1` pulls the computer image every time a computer starts |
| `UNDERSTUDY_COMPUTER_ENV` | Comma-separated names of the variables below to forward to every computer |

**Computer** (forwarded through `UNDERSTUDY_COMPUTER_ENV`)

| Variable | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, or `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` with `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Run the Claude brain on an API key or gateway instead of each owner's subscription |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | The same for the ChatGPT brain |
| `UNDERSTUDY_ENABLE_CODEX` | `true` offers the ChatGPT (Codex) brain, which is experimental |
| `UNDERSTUDY_FAKE_BRAIN` | `1` replaces the brain with a scripted one, for testing without any account |

For example, to run every understudy on one Anthropic key, set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `UNDERSTUDY_COMPUTER_ENV=ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

## Starting tasks by email

Each task can get its own email address. Mail to it starts the task with the email quoted as untrusted data (sender, subject, text) and its attachments saved in the understudy's inbox; approvals are always required on these runs. By default only senders from the owner's email domain are accepted, and each task can list other addresses or domains.

- **Amazon SES:** `infra/aws/06-inbound-email.sh` sets up receiving on a subdomain (MX and DKIM records, an encrypted S3 bucket that keeps mail 30 days, an SNS topic that notifies the panel, and a role the panel uses to read the mail). The panel checks the SNS signature, the topic and the bucket, and only accepts mail that passes DMARC and the spam and virus scans.
- **Any other provider:** forward each message as raw MIME with `POST /api/inbound/email`, `Authorization: Bearer $UNDERSTUDY_INBOUND_TOKEN`, `Content-Type: message/rfc822` and, optionally, `X-Understudy-Recipients: a@your.domain,b@your.domain`. Authenticating the sender (SPF, DKIM, DMARC) is then your provider's job.
